# Final Project Plan -- TODO: SPELL CHECK!!
DATA 512, Fall 2017

## Introduction

Parking is big business in Seattle. In 2013 alone, the city of Seattle grossed $37 million in parking revenue for on-street parking$^1$. This does not include revenue for off-street parking, such as other paid parking options, including private lots or game-day spaces (e.g. Seahawks, Mariners, Sounders).



In ___ the City of Seattle installed meters. From 2014 they have made parking data available.

I plan to analyze this data as my final project for DATA 512: Human-Centered Data Science, Fall 2017, University of Washington Data Scinece Mastsers Program.

## Research Questions:

I want to try to answer the following reserach questions

### Parking Trends

I am interested in looking at parking trends in general. For instance:

*How do parking trends differ by area/date/time/season?*

This question does not have any specific deliverables. I will summarize the data and publish any interesting results.

### Ill-gotten gains

A 2009 Seattle Times report revealed that in some areas, parking kiosks allow customers to pay for parking beyond the time allowed. For example, No Parking signs may specify that certain blocks are off limits after 3pm; however, some kiosks in these areas allowed customers to pay for parking until 6pm. This sort of programming oversight costs customers money, both in paying for unusable parking spots, but also often results in impound fees.

This story broke in 2009 but I want to see if I can identify any areas where this may still be going on. I do not have impound records, but I do have time limits for parking areas, as well as records of when/where people paid for parking and for what duration. I will look to see if any customer transactions include a duration that extends past the time of legal parking.

If there are instances, I plan to calculate:

*How much money does the city make illegally by charging for parking when there are restrictions in place (see Seattle Times article)?*

### Anonymity

A big part of human-centered design is the concept of informed consent and anonymity. While this data does not include any identifying information, I want to test the limits of this supposed anonymity by seeing if perhaps I can identify any trends that may allow me to pinpoint specific users. For example, one of the fields in the dataset is whether users paid cash or card. At a glance it appears most users pay with card. Suppose there is a certain city block where only one cash transaction takes place each morning at about the same time of day. This might be indicative of a specific user with specific parking and payment habits. Identifying such users, combined with other published data (e.g. parking duration), may allow for nefarious means.

*Can individual drivers be identified?*

## Extra stuff...

For this assignment, you will write up a study plan for your final class project. The plan will cover a variety of details about your final project, including what data you will use, what you will do with the data (e.g. statistical analysis, train a model), what results you expect or intend, and most importantly, why your project is interesting or important (and to whom, besides yourself).
